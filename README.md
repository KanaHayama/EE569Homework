# EE569Homework
My solutions for USC 19Spring EE569 Homeworks.

This is my first semester in USC (and in USA), EE569 is strongly not recomended for new-coming students by academic advisors. However, I finally enrolled in this course.

I think EE569 is not difficult, but it do take **a lot of** time to finish homeworks.
